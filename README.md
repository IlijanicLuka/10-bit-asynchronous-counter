# 10-bit-asynchronous-counter
This project presents the implementation of a 10-bit asynchronous counter on an FPGA platform. The count cycle from 0 to 1023 is displayed on four 7-segment displays, with the option to set and reset using two buttons on the DE10-Lite development board. The 10-bit asynchronous counter is structurally modeled using JK flip-flops. The counter's state changes are triggered by a clock pulse provided through the GPIO interface, generated by a 555 timer circuit in astable mode. The design of the asynchronous counter and the conversion from binary to BCD signal were executed in Quartus Prime software using the VHDL programming language.
